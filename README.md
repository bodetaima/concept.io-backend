# Concept.io Back-end

### Idea
#### Concept.io is a personal workspace where you can store notes, plans, and get organized.

This web application actually is a clone of [Notion](https://notion.so), only for personal favor and sharpening skills. I really like the idea of Notion, and as a messy person, I need an organized workspace myself.

This also is a side project, which means I only have 2 hours per day to spend on. Hoping it will come real one day.

### Up and running
    # Install dependencies
    yarn install
    
    # Dev server
    yarn run live
    
Have fun hacking!
